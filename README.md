The Dome is a modpack that’s built off BCG+ and ALL credit goes to Jflec

Forged in the foundation of a comfy and cozy experience, I wanted to push this pack into a different direction, starting with a refreshed UI, Quests, and requested Tech mods. It still has all of the same things you love in BCG+ and will have more in the future. 
So go ahead, click on “Create a World,” and drag your friends into it why don’t you? Scroll through the varieties in blocks, create bathrooms with musical frogs while you fight a world war on a toilet, or just make a dirt hut. Fly Aircrafts, sail the seven seas, or crash a Car into your witch hut (She’s evil). Make a local 7/11 and sell different types of Food for Money, or just sell your crops in the Selling Bin. BCG+ follows a progression system like Vanilla Minecraft, making it familiar enough to easily find your way around, but with enough twists to keep things interesting!
